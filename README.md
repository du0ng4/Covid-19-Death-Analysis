# Covid-19 Death Analysis

One of the questions during the Covid-19 pandemic was why different countries have such different proportions of deaths relative to the number of disease cases.
There were several hypotheses about this, including differences in medical facilities (countries with more hospitals should see fewer deaths), age demographics (countries with a larger proportion of older people will see more deaths), and existing mortality rates between countries (indicating pre-existing differences in overall health between countries).  
The goal of this project was to use linear modeling to quantify some of the variation in mortality from Covid-19 in different counties due to differences in hospital infrastructure and demographics.
